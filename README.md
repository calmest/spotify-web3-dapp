SPOTIFY WEB3 DAPP WITH NEXT.JS
--------------------------------

This is an application built on the SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN using the ANCHOR FRAMEWORK in the programming language called RUST.

I stored the music data on the SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN.

I used QUICKNODE as my RPC provider to connect to the BLOCKCHAIN.

I used CARGO to compile and deploy my smart contract.

I used PHATOM WALLET to authenticate the users that sign in and out of the application. I used PHATOM WALLET because it's one of the best wallet out there to pair up with SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN because it's seemless and the UI is beautiful.

I used the SOLANA WEB3.js package to interact with the smart contract on the BLOCKCHAIN.

I used CONTEXT API to manage the built-in music player on the SPOTIFY APP.

This application is/was deployed and hosted on digital ocean.
